## Story 

You are an elephant with wings, and you have to fly through the pipes... 

## Features

 * Jump
 * Die

## Controls
 
 * Press `space` to jump.
 * Press `R` to reset.
 * Press `F1` to disable the profiler and the debug overlay.
   _Note: the profiler takes a huge toll on performance as it forces the GPU to sync with the CPU after each render pass._
